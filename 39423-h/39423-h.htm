<h2>PREFACE.</h2>


<p>The first edition of Gray's Manual was published in 1848.
It was to a great extent rewritten and its range extended in
1856, and it was again largely rewritten in 1867. The great
advances that have since been made in systematic botany and
in the knowledge of our flora have for several years past made
another revision desirable, which Dr. Gray before his death
was purposing to undertake.</p>

<p>The present editors, acting to the best of their ability in
his stead, have endeavored throughout to follow his methods
and views. The original plan, so long retained by Dr. Gray
and so generally approved, has been closely adhered to, the
characters and descriptions of the last edition have been left
essentially unchanged so far as possible, and in the numerous
alterations and additions that have been considered necessary
or advisable, his conclusions and principles have governed in
every matter of importance, so far as they could be known.
The effort especially has been to maintain that high standard
of excellence which has always made the Manual an authority
among botanists.</p>

<p>In the treatment of the genera and species, Gray's Synoptical
Flora has been made the basis in the revision of the Gamopetalous
Orders, and the manuscript in continuation of that work,
so far as prepared, for the Polypetalous Orders which precede
<i>Leguminosæ</i> (excepting <i>Nuphar</i>, the <i>Cruciferæ, Caryophyllaceæ,
Vitis</i>, and the small Orders numbered 18, 22, 23, 25&ndash;27, and
29). The genus <i>Salix</i> has been rewritten for this edition by
<span class="smcap">M.&nbsp;S. Bebb</span>, Esq., the genus <i>Carex</i> by Prof. <span class="smcap">L.&nbsp;H. Bailey</span>, and
the Ferns and allied orders by Prof. <span class="smcap">D.&nbsp;C. Eaton</span>. For the
rest, all known available sources of information have been
made use of, and much willing help has been received from
botanists in all parts of our territory.</p>

<p><a name="page2"></a>The increasing interest that is taken in the study of the
Cellular Cryptogams, and the desire to encourage it, have led
to the inclusion again of the Hepaticæ, which were omitted
in the last edition. These have been prepared through the
kindness of Prof. <span class="smcap">L.&nbsp;M. Underwood</span>, though the limits of
the volume have necessitated somewhat briefer descriptions
than he considered desirable. The three fine plates illustrating
the genera of these Orders, which were used in the early
editions, are also added, with a supplementary one, as well as
an additional one in illustration of the Grasses, thus increasing
the number of plates to twenty-five. A Glossary of botanical
terms is appended, to meet an expressed need of those who
use the Manual alone, and a Synopsis of the Orders in their
sequence is given, to contrast more clearly their characters, and
to show the general principles which have determined their
present arrangement. This should be a useful adjunct to the
more artificially arranged Analytical Key.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Geographical Limits, and Distribution.</span>&mdash;The southern
limit of the territory covered by the present work is the same
as in the later previous editions, viz. the southern boundary of
Virginia and Kentucky. This coincides better than any other
geographical line with the natural division between the cooler-temperate
and the warm-temperate vegetation of the Atlantic
States. The rapid increase of population west of the Mississippi
River, and the growing need of a Manual covering the
flora of that section, have seemed a sufficient reason for the
extension of the limits of the work westward to the 100th
meridian, thus connecting with the <i>Manual of the Flora of the
Rocky Mountain Region</i> by Prof. Coulter. These limits, as
well as that upon the north, have been in general strictly
observed, very few species being admitted that are not known
with some degree of certainty to occur within them. The extreme
western flora is no doubt imperfectly represented.</p>

<p>The distribution of the individual species is indicated somewhat
more definitely than heretofore in many cases, so far as
it could be satisfactorily ascertained. The extralimital range
is also sometimes given, but the terms "northward," "southward,"
and "westward" are more frequently employed, signifying
an indefinite range in those directions beyond the limits
of the Manual. Where no definite habitat is specified, the species<a name="page3"></a>
may be understood as found more or less generally throughout
the whole area, or at least to near the western limits.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Nomenclature, Accentuation of Names</span>, etc.&mdash;In case
of question respecting the proper name to be adopted for any
species, Dr. Gray's known and expressed views have been followed,
it is believed, throughout the work. While reasonable
regard has been paid to the claims of priority, the purpose has
been to avoid unnecessary changes, in the belief that such
changes are in most cases an unmitigated evil. Synonyms are
rarely given except where changes have been made. As a guide
to correct pronunciation, the long sound of the accented vowel
(modified often in personal names) is indicated, as heretofore,
by the grave accent (`), and the short sound by the acute (´).
In regard to the derivations of generic names, many valuable
suggestions have been due to W.&nbsp;R. Gerard, Esq., of New York.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Prominent Characters</span> are indicated by the use of <i>Italic
type</i> for the leading distinctions of the Orders, and generally
in the specific descriptions for those points by which two or
more nearly allied species may be most readily distinguished.
The ready discrimination of the genera is provided for by a
Synopsis of their leading characters under each order. Whenever
a genus comprises several species, pains have been taken
to render important differences conspicuous by proper grouping,
and when needed by a series of subordinate divisions and
subdivisions. The headings of these various groups are to be
considered as belonging to and forming a part of the specific
characters of the several species under them,&mdash;a fact which
the student should always bear in mind.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Arrangement of the Orders.</span>&mdash;The Natural Orders are
disposed in very close accordance with the method followed
by Bentham and Hooker in the <i>Genera Plantarum</i>, the principles
of which are concisely shown in the Synopsis of Orders
which precedes the Analytical Key. The <i>Gymnospermæ</i> are
retained as a Subclass following the Angiospermous Dicotyledons,
with which they have an obvious relationship, in preference
to placing them, as some authorities would do, next
before the Pteridophytes, to which their affinity, if no less
certain, is nevertheless obscure. A more natural arrangement
than either would be the withdrawal of the Endogens,
placing them at the beginning, in perhaps an inverse order.</p>

<p><a name="page4"></a><span class="smcap">Analytical Key to the Orders.</span>&mdash;As stated in Dr. Gray's
Preface to the last edition, this is designed to enable the student
to refer readily to its proper Order any of our plants,
upon taking the pains to ascertain the structure of its flowers,
and sometimes of the fruit, and by following out a series of
easy steps in the analysis. It is founded upon the most obvious
distinctions which will answer the purpose, and is so
contrived as to provide for all or nearly all exceptional
instances and variant cases. Referring to the Order which the
Key leads him to, the student will find its most distinctive
points brought together and printed in Italics in the first sentence
of the ordinal description, and thus can verify his results.
The Synopsis which follows will then lead him to the genus,
to be verified in turn by the full generic description in its
place; and the progress thence to the species is facilitated,
when there are several to choose from, by the arrangement
under divisions and subdivisions, as already explained.</p>

<p>It will be seen that the Key directs the inquirer to ascertain,
first, the Class of the plant under consideration,&mdash;which,
even without the seeds, is revealed at once by the plan of the
stem, as seen in a cross-section, and usually by the veining of
the leaves, and is commonly confirmed by the numerical plan
of the flower;&mdash;then, if of the first Class, the Subclass is at
once determined by the pistil, whether of the ordinary kind,
or an open scale bearing naked ovules. If the former, then
the choice between the three Divisions is determined by the
presence or absence of the petals, and whether separate or
united. Each Division is subdivided by equally obvious characters,
and, finally, a series of successively subordinated propositions,&mdash;each
set more indented upon the page than the preceding,&mdash;leads
to the name of the Order sought for, followed
by the number of the page upon which it is described
in the body of the work.</p>

<p>The book is now submitted to those for whose benefit it has
been prepared, in the trust that its shortcomings will meet
with friendly indulgence, and with the earnest request that
information be kindly given of any corrections or additions that
may appear to be necessary.</p>

aromatic oil. (These are best seen in slices made across the fruit.) Seed
suspended from the summit of the cell, anatropous, with a minute embryo
in hard albumen.&mdash;Stems usually hollow. Leaves alternate, mostly compound,
the petioles expanded or sheathing at base, rarely with true
stipules. Umbels usually compound, in which case the secondary ones
are termed <i>umbellets</i>; the whorl of bracts which often subtends the general
umbel is the <i>involucre</i>, and those of the umbellets the <i>involucels</i>. The
base of the styles is frequently thickened and cushion-like, and called
the <i>stylopodium</i>. In many the flowers are <i>dichogamous</i>, i.e. the styles
are protruded from the bud some time before the anthers develop,&mdash;an

<p>Flowers unisexual, destitute of floral envelopes, disposed in spikes; the
staminate consisting of three stamens, in the axil of a bract, or <i>scale</i>; the
pistillate comprising a single pistil with a bifid or trifid style, forming in fruit
a hard lenticular or triangular achene, which is enclosed in a sac (<i>perigynium</i>)
formed by the complete union of the borders of a bractlet or of connate bractlets
and borne in the axil of a bract, or <i>scale</i>. Staminate and pistillate flowers
borne in different parts of the spike (spike <i>androgynous</i>), or in separate
spikes on the same culm, or rarely the plant diœcious.&mdash;Perennial grass-like
herbs with mostly triangular culms, 3-ranked leaves, usually with rough margins
and keel, and spikes in the axils of leafy or scale-like bracts, often aggregated
into heads. An exceedingly critical genus, the study of which should
be attempted only with complete and fully mature specimens. (The classical
Latin name, of obscure signification; derived by some from <span class="greek">κείρω</span>, <i>to cut</i>, on account
of the sharp leaves&mdash;as the English name <i>Shear-grass</i>.) (Pl. 5 and 6.)</p>

<p>[Footnote 1: Elaborated for this edition by Prof. <span class="smcap">L.&nbsp;M. Underwood</span>, of Syracuse, N.&nbsp;Y.]</p>

<p>Plants usually procumbent, consisting of a simple thallus, a
thalloid stem, or a leafy axis; leaves when present 2-ranked,
with uniform leaf-cells and no midvein; thalloid forms with
or without a midvein, smooth or scurfy or scaly beneath and
usually with numerous rootlets. Sexual reproduction by antheridia
and archegonia, which are immersed in the thallus,
or sessile or pedicelled upon it, or borne on a peduncled receptacle.
The fertilized archegonium develops into a capsule
(<i>sporogonium</i>) closely invested by a calyptra, which ruptures
above as the ripened capsule (containing numerous spores and
usually elaters) pushes upward. It is also commonly surrounded
by a usually double involucre, the inner (often called
<i>perianth</i>) more or less tubular, the outer tubular or more often
foliaceous, sometimes wholly wanting. Propagation is also
effected by offshoots (<i>innovations</i>), runners (<i>flagella</i>), or by
<i>gemmæ</i>, which appear at the margin of the leaves or on the
surface of the thallus, often in special receptacles.</p>

<p class="genus" id="sphaerocarpus"><b>2. SPHÆROCÁRPUS</b>, Micheli. (<a href="#plate22">Pl. 22.</a>)</p>

<p>Thallus lobed, without costa or epidermis. Involucres sessile, obconic or
pyriform, perforated at the apex, continuous with the thallus at base. Calyptra
closely investing the single globose indehiscent capsule, crowned with a
deciduous point. Spores globose, muriculate, remaining united in a coccus.
Antheridia borne in follicular bodies on the surface of a separate thallus.&mdash;An
anomalous genus, perhaps more closely related to the Jungermanniaceæ.

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
